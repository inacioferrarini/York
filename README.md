### What is it?

York is a set of classes, that can be used together or not.
Every class has one responsibility and one responsibility only, being fully adherent to S.O.L.I.D. principles.


### Goals

* Eliminate Singleton usage (you don't need it)
* Dramatically reduce ViewControllers' size.
* Provide a block-based approach to common situations.
* Provide an easy project startup and reduce project startup time.
* Through the usage of a well designed base classes, provide a standard that will keep the project as standardized as possible.


### Structure

In order to make easier to understand every class role, they were grouped together:
* Context: Essentially, a way I found to avoid Singleton usage by injecting the App's Context.
* DataSyncRules: A basic time rule engine used to handle data synchronization gracefully and without hassle.
* DeepLinkingNavigation: Abstracts JLRoutes's usage for scheme-based navigation.
* Extensions: Basic extensions for common usage of UIKit and other classes.
* Logging: Abstracts CocoaLumberJack's usage for logging.
* Persistence: Contains the CoreDataStack, which handles boiler-plate code for CoreData, and a UITableViewDataSource based on CoreData and NSFetchedResultsController, which avoids NSFetchedResultsController boiler-plate code to be placed at the TableViewController.  
* Presenter: Classes used to handle how TableViewCells will be presented.
* TableViewDelegate: UITableViewDelegate alternative implementations, using blocks to handle used interaction events.
* ViewController: View Controllers implementations, supporting internationalization out of the box, data synchronization and Table View Implementations.
  * BaseViewController: The simplest UIViewController supporting internationalization out of the box.
  * BaseDataBasedViewController: Adds data synchronization capabilities to BaseViewController.
  * BaseTableViewController: Adds TableViewController capabilities to BaseDataBasedViewController. Allows the ViewController itself to be the Delegate or/and DataSource of the TableView, or, using the proper method, return the Delegate or/and DataSource to be used.
* ViewController: Basic class for Xib-based view components.


## Requirements
